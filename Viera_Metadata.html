			<h1>Top Reasons to buy a Motorcycle!</h1>
			
				<p>They're less costly than a car! You spend less money on a motorcycle nowadays than you would on a car. Insurance and other things like wheels and maintenance will cost you less because of the smaller vehicle.
				
				<p>They have better fuel efficiency than cars do. Because of motorcycles being not as spacious as cars, you are able to ride longer without having to stop and refill. This saves you money and time! Motorcycles use up at least as many miles as a car, if not more.</p>
					
				<p>They have a positive impact on the environment because of motorcycles have less carbon-dioxide emissions, fewer natural resources are made to create the bike, and less raw materials are needed for the process. Also, it's so much easier to park on a bike rather than a car because of the congested spaces in parking lots. Plus, you have the whole parking space to fit your small bike into!</p>
