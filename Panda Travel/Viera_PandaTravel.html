	<h1>Sacsayhuaman Peru</h1>
	
		<p>This Inca fortress overlooks the city of Cusco. Sacsayhuaman can be variously translated as 'speckled falcon' or 'speckled head'. There is a belief that the city of Cusco was set out in the form of a puma whose head was the hill of Sacsayhuaman.</p>

		<h3>Why you should visit the Ruins!</h3>
			<p>The Sacsayhuaman ruins make for an awesome half-day trip from Cusco city centre. They are easily reached, with a short drive from the city centre. The ruins can be combined with a visit to other, smaller nearby ruins, or as a standalone visit in itself. Located outside the city centre, the views over the city are spectacular from this historic site, and make it one of the best things to do in Cusco.</p>
			
		<h3>Other Things to do around the Area</h3>
			<p>The Cerro Colorado Vinicunca is a beautiful area to visit while you're already in the Sacsayhuaman Ruins. The Apupacha Horse Adventure is a great family activity where you can enjoy the scenery from the back of a horse! Amazon Wildlife Peru is another great family day that you can all enjoy while looking out the animals like, rare monkeys, anaconda, sloth, tapir, and more!</p>

				<li>My husband and I went there for our honeymoon, and he isn't usually as big fan of these kinds of things. BUT, we both ended up enjoying the history we saw in the ruins and enjoyed seeing all of the different kinds of fortresses that were built from such a long time ago. We loved it there!
