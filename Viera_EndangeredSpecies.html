<h1>The American Marten - Martes Americana</h1><!--One of the main heading of information-->


<p>American martens, Martes americana, are found in the northern reaches of North America. The species is present from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia west to Alaska and south into sections of the rocky mountain range and California. Martens are found sporadically in parts of New York state, Michigan, Minnesota, Maine, and Wisconsin.</p>

<h3>Habitat</h3>

<p>Martes americana is found primarily in mature, northern forests. These animals are closely associated with lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, spruce, and mixed harwood forests. They tend to be found in complex forests, and can occur at all areas where such habitat exists. They den in hollow trees or vacant ground burrows.</p>

<h3>Are they endangered?</h3>


<p>The cutting of vast areas of mature conifer forests destroyed much of the American marten habitat in the Sierra Nevada. Collection of pelts has reduced populations in many parts of the species range. The destruction of their forest habitat has also led to decreased numbers. In spite of these threats, American martens are not considered endangered.</p>
